    <p>
      Dear <%=@user.first_name %> <%=@user.last_name %>,
      You recently selected <%=@user.email %> as your new Yomu Labs Id. To verify this email address belongs to you, click the link below and then sign in using your Yomu Labs ID and password.
      <a href="<%=confirmation_url %>">Verify Now</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why you received this email.
      Yomu Labs requests verification whenever an email address is selected as an Yomu Labs ID. Your Yomu Labs cannot be used until you verify it.
      If you didnâ€™t make this change or if you believe an unauthorized person is attempting to access your account, you can reset your password by going to Yomu Labs ID.
      <br/>
      To login to the site, just follow this link: <a href="<%=@url%>">Yomu Labs Sign In</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,<br/>
      Yomu Labs Support
